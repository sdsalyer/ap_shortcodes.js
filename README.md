## Actual Play Shortcodes for shortcode.js
_By Spencer @ [WispsOfTime.com](http://wispsoftime.com)_

A drop-in JavaScript solution for formatting your RPG actual-play reports. Add 3 lines to your website's `<head>` and you're good to go.

* Wrap your narrative bits in `[story]` tags
* Set die rolls apart, inline or block, with the `[dice]` tag.
* Hide mechanics and more behind expanding `[spoiler]` tags.

A fork of [shortcode.js](https://github.com/nicinabox/shortcode.js), which does all the heavy lifting, **ap_shortcodes.js** is simply definitions and styles for useful shortcodes to meet the most common actual play report formatting needs.

See **example.html** for ... _examples_... or check out this [Blogger demo site](https://actualplayformat.blogspot.com/#example).

### Usage

1. Include references to **shortcode.js**, **ap_shortcodes.js**, and **ap_shortcodes.css** in your page's `<head>` tag. If you want to use the defaults, simply paste in the below from the RawGit CDN service. If you anticipate making changes, you may want to download the files and include them from your site, instead.

```html
    <script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/sdsalyer/ap_shortcodes.js/master/js/shortcode.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/sdsalyer/ap_shortcodes.js/master/js/ap_shortcodes.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/sdsalyer/ap_shortcodes.js/master/css/ap_shortcodes.css"></link>
```

2. (Optional) Alter **ap_shortcodes.js** to add/edit shortcodes. Alter **ap_shortcodes.css** to add/edit the associated styles -- alternatively, you could simply override them by defining your own styles in the `<head>` below the CSS `<link>` tag.
3. Use the shortcodes in your actual play report, then ooh and ahh at the results!

### Examples

```
[note]This won't do a thing because we didn't create a note shortcode[/note]

[story]This is my story,
this is my song[/story]

[story title="This is my story..." style="fancy"]
This is my [fancy!] song, written by a [fancy!] bard, which sings the song of six pence for the joy of all around.[/story]

[dice]These are my dice, these are my polyhedrals[/dice]

And these are [dice style="inline"]my inline mechanics[/dice], which are a wonderful treat.

[spoiler title="Don't click here, or you might learn a secret!"]
    The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men
    Gang aft agley
    
            -- To a Mouse, Robert Burns
